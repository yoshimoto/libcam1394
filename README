RESTRICTIONS
------------

To use this library, you'll need the custom 1394 driver.  It is not
compatible with one in standard linux kernel-2.4.x. If you have not
installed the driver, please refer to my web site:
http://limu.is.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~yosimoto/ieee1394/.

These library and driver will probably change radically in the future;
weak attempts will be made to retain some level of source-file
compatibility.
