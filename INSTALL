  libcam1394 installation
---------------------------------------------

Installation 
------------

For installation you can use these commands:

./configure
make
make install

If the configure script cannot find header file ohci_iso.h (usually in
/usr/include/linux directory), please check if you have installed
driver for for current version of your kernel. The driver is available
at my web site, http://limu.is.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~yosimoto/ieee1394/

Note: If you change kernel sources frequently, please, check if you have
      installed ieee1394 driver for current version of your kernel.


Compilation of static library
-----------------------------

If you would like to use the static libcam1394 library, you need to
use these options for the configure script:

./configure --enable-shared=no --enable-static=yes

Unfortunately, due to bug in the libtool script, the shared and static
library cannot be built together.
